### Use Case
### Medical vs Synthetic data
Compared to synthetic data which is usually used to evaluate model performance, medical datasets are based off of CT scans, which sample data only in one axis.

To evaluate a model for the medical application and ensure comparability with existing methodologies, we use a dataset employed in the MedNeRF containing digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) with 20 examples for chest and 5 examples for knee, each consisting of 72 128Ã—128 images taken every 5 degrees, covering full 360-degree vertical rotation per patient. To account
for differences between synthetic and medical datasets we change the sampling angle to only cover one axis as the MedNeRF authors did, and change the model configuration to not assume a white background for the training data. We train the model on a single example for each experiment.

### MedNeRF
MedNeRF utilizes GRAF based model to produce accurate 3D projections from few or single view x-ray. GRAF uses SIREN to generate
shape and appearance vectors used to describe predicted NeRF patch for a given view angle. Due to training GAN on medical datasets which, due to their nature are usually quite small, a number of issues,
such as mode collapse can occur. The authors solve that by combining GRAF with DAG and using multiple discriminator heads.
